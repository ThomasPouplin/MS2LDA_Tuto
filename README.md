Metabolomics-tools
==================

This repository contains various experimental codes to explore and process LC-MS feature data. Most of the codes are done in Python using Numpy/Scipy. Sometimes you'd see Matlab.

Explanations:

* **AdductLevels** contains adduct stuff.
* **alignment** contains some alignment experiments.
* **discretisation** contains various models to cluster peak features after discretised, based on their mass relationships etc.  
* **precursor_clustering** don't know what it's for

# Set the method you want to use for peak detection and MS1-MS2 pairing:
# - 1 is using a modified xcmsSetFragments script that is suitable to use with high-resolution data (with the courtesy of Dr Tony Larson who provided it)
#     The script extracts MS1 features from the fragmentation file and subsequently pairs MS2 spectra to them according to the method specified in the script
# - 2 is similar to 1, but it is possible to define the MS1 features from a separate (full scan) file
# - 3 is using scripts based on the RMassBank suite (with the courtesy of Dr Emma Schymanski who provided the scripts containing the pairing functions)
#     The scripts can use an mzXML file or .csv file containing (at least) mz and rt information in separate columns, and additional information like intensity and 
#     peak identifiers can be added [see example peaklist1.csv and peaklist2.csv, respectively]. The fragmentation file has to be in .mzML format.
